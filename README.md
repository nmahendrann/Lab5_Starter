## Questions
1) I would assume it is a little difficult to unit test a messaging feature, which is defined as where one user sends a message to the other. This is because there are many interactions across components, such as the original user sending the message, the message gets encoded correctly, and is recieved exactly as is typed by the original user. Unit testing's weakness is testing how these individual components interact with each other on an application/feature level, which is the case.
2) This function can be easily tested with unit testing as various positive and negative test cases can be written to make sure this feature works properly. There are also no interactions outside the feature being tested itself, so this is a completely valid use of the unit test feature.


I had to refork the repo because the github pages was broken on my other repo. I updated to all the working code here, but it might look a little messy.
